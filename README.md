## What is `git-curate?`

`git-curate` is a CLI tool designed to streamline the process of rebasing and "curating" a branch.

At [Planning Center](https://github.com/planningcenter), we use the `staging` branch as an integration environment. Team members regularly push work to `staging` so others can test, verify, and explore changes collaboratively. While this workflow is ergonomic and efficient, `staging` can become crowded over time.

To keep things tidy, someone typically "resets" the branch â€” rebasing it onto `main` and selectively merging in relevant open GitHub PRs. While not difficult, this process can be tedious and doesn't always feel great.

`git-curate` automates that workflow:
- Rebases the target branch (e.g., staging) onto the base branch (e.g., `main`)
- Fetches all open pull requests using the GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Lets you interactively select which PRs to merge
- Merges the selected PRs
- Optionally pushes the updated target branch to the remote


This flow would also work well to create a new branch and merge in some in-flight PRs to start off at the right spot (vs having to manually curate that branch).


## Installation

### Using yarn (recommended)
```bash
yarn global add git-curate

### Using npm
```bash
npm install -g git-curate

### Prerequisites
1. Install the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and authenticate:
   ```bash
